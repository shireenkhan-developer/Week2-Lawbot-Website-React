# Getting Started with Create React App

"# Week2-Lawbot-Website-React" 

The Application has the following feautures:

 1. Make a request to this API https://randomuser.me/ and get at least 10 unique random people. 
 2. Display these people in form of a list just as you would see in Facebook friend suggestions. 
 3. To employ React to the fullest, these list items should are separate React components. 
 4. Upon clicking a list item, the item expands and show some random details about that user.
 5. All profile cards have a cross button.Clicking on the cross button deletes them from the view using useState hook.
